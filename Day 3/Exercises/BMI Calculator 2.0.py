# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

bmi = round(weight / (height ** 2))  # Use brackets to prioritise Multiplication over Division

if bmi < 18.5:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight.")
elif bmi < 25:  # 'elif' is only used when the previous IF Statement is not True
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you have a normal weight.")
elif bmi < 30:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are slightly overweight.")
elif bmi < 35:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are obese.")
else:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are clinically obese.")

# We don't have to keep writing >18.5 for the BMI because the statements are executed in order,
# one after the other, so we have already tested before it's value being 18.5, we can move on
